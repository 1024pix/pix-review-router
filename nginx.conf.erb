# Expected behavior for this nginx configuration:
#  * App routes are routed to front application with app name from requested host inserted into request path:
#
#    https://orga-pr123.review.pix.fr/some/path   -> https://pix-front-integration-pr123.scalingo.io/orga/some/path
#
#  * API routes whose app is neither "editor" nor "lcms" are routed to the API application:
#
#    https://app-pr123.review.pix.fr/api/route   -> https://pix-api-review-pr123.scalingo.io/api/route
#
#  * API routes whose app is either "editor" or "lcms" are routed to the lcms application:
#
#    https://lcms-pr123.review.pix.fr/api/route   -> https://pix-lcms-review-pr123.scalingo.io/api/route
#
#  * When the requested app is "api", route to API application without modifying path:
#
#    https://api-pr123.review.pix.fr/metrics   -> https://pix-api-review-pr123.scalingo.io/metrics
#
#  * When the requested app is "pix-site", route to pix site application:
#
#    https://site-pr123.review.pix.fr/some/path  -> https://pix-site-review-pr123.scalingo.io/some/path
#
#  * When the requested app is "editor", route to pix lcms site application:
#
#    https://editor.review.pix.fr/some/path  -> https://pix-lcms-review-pr123.scalingo.io/some/path
#
#  * When the requested app is "lcms", route to pix lcms application:
#
#    https://lcms.review.pix.fr/some/path  -> https://pix-lcms-review-pr123.scalingo.io/some/path
