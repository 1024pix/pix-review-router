# Expected behavior for this nginx configuration:
#  * App routes are routed to front application with app name from requested host inserted into request path:
#
#    https://orga-pr123.review.pix.fr/some/path   -> https://pix-front-integration-pr123.scalingo.io/orga/some/path
#
#  * API routes are routed to the API application:
#
#    https://app-pr123.review.pix.fr/api/route   -> https://pix-api-review-pr123.scalingo.io/api/route
#
#  * When the requested app is "api", route to API application without modifying path:
#
#    https://api-pr123.review.pix.fr/metrics   -> https://pix-api-review-pr123.scalingo.io/metrics
#
#  * When the requested app is "pix-site", route to pix site application:
#
#    https://site-pr123.review.pix.fr/some/path  -> https://pix-site-review-pr123.scalingo.io/some/path

# This regex matches host names like:
#    orga-pr123.review.pix.fr
# and sets variables:
#    $app = "orga"
#    $pr = "pr123"
server_name ~^(?<app>[^-]+)-(?<pr>[^.]+)(.+)$;

location / {
  # Consider requested $app to be "api" if the path starts with "/api/"
  if ($uri ~ ^/api/) {
    set $app "api";
  }

  # Default to routing to front application with app as prefix
  set $prefix "/$app";
  set $scalingo_app "pix-front-review";

  # If requested app is "api": route to API application and do not change path

  # If requested app is "site": route to pix site application and do not change path
